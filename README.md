# Postal Time Tool

A simple app that displays time in the united states postal service format.

The USPS uses a combination of military time + hour hundredths. 1:15 pm = 1325.

## Purpose

Surprisingly, there isn't a readily available resource for this format. My poor friend, who works for the post office, has to use this complicated format, and they handle all their conversions my hand with a chart.

We in the programming world don't do math, we get computers to do it for us.

## Requirements

### Functional

- UI doesn't need to be slick, just needs to work
- display the current time in Postal service format
- have a field to convert to and from the format to normal 12 hour time.
- a stopwatch?
